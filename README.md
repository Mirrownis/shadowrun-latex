## How to use

Duplicate the main.tex file and insert your own content. Choose between the print style for ease of reading and saving ink, or the fancy style to get a fancy background and cool colors. The layout should stay the same between the two, so it's just a question of presentation. Easy as that.

## Credits and such

The design is heavily inspired by Shadowrun 5e and 6e. Font and colors are not proprietary to the best of my knowledge.
I made that background art myself. The logo is part of a discontinued Patreon of mine and can be used freely. Credit me if possible.
